# Blank OS User's Manual

## Getting started

### Installation and emulation/execution

Please refer to the relevant sections in the project `README.md` available in the root folder.

### First steps

Once you have launched the OS for the first time, you should first see the welcome banner with the system version. Then, the kernel shell will spawn and you will be able to execute commands.

To get the list of available commands on the system, type `help`.

## Next what?

Once programs will be added, there will be more info here. For now you can just play around and make the kernel panic. That's it.
