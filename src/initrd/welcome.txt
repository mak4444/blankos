* Welcome to BlankOS! *

Congratulations, you've entered my small world!

You can try all the commands, try tweaking stuff like explained
in the DEVELOPERS.md file, and even contribute if you got the
guts. lol.

Don't look too much at the code, it's badly designed, but hey,
that's my first OS project so I find it kinda cool.

There's no paging, ring 3, processes... I am not smart enough
for all this modern stuff. Let's keep it simple and stay in 
ring0, without processes, maybe one day there'll be more
advanced features, but not today.

** Why am I doing this?

I wanted to explore the world of low-level programing.
As I had only 1 year of experience in C, it was super challenging
especially at the beginning, and I needed much time to understand
even the most basic things around OSDev.

I'll backup the project on archival media once it'll be at a good
enough point; I think it's cool to leave a trace of my passage on
Earth.

** Easter eggs

To make the exploration a bit funnier, I hid some easter eggs
around. You can try to find them if you have time to lose.
